## Machine Learning - Dr. Thomas Trappenberg (Dalhousie University)

### Assignment 1: Applied Machine Learning on wine dataset
This assignment is designed to practice Python and to introduce sklearn library for machine learning in Python.

### Assignment 2: Regression, Probability Theory, and Optimization
Implemented linear regression from scratch with various loss functions and optimization techniques. Studied loss function to understand how good the learning rate of the current algorithm is. Implementation of various generalization techniques such as ridge and lasso regression along with optimization technique like momentum. Solved simple probability problems.

### Assignment 3: EM (Expectation Maximization) and Bayes Nets.
This assignment consists of unsupervised learning algorithm (EM) implementation from scratch. Developed an understanding of Causal models. Also implemented Bayesian network (Naive Bayes classification) to understand conditional independence assumption.

### Assignment 4: Multilayer Perceptron.
Solved pattern recognition problem with a multi-layer perceptron. Tuned various hyper-parameters to improve accuracy.

### Assignment 5: CNN (Convolution Neural Network).
Understanding the basic structure of a CNN through tensorflow in python.

### Assignment 6: Reinforcement Learning.
Implementing reinforcement learning to calculate optimal Q values for a linear maze with given reward, transition, and policy functions.
